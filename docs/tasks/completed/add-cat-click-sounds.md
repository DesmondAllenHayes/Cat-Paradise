# Add Cat Click Sound Effects

## Status
âœ“ Completed on 2025-09-12

## Overview
Added seven different sound effects that play randomly when clicking the cat.

## Implementation Details
- Added sound initialization and management in `cats.js`
- Implemented sound pooling to prevent overlap
- Added random selection with no-repeat logic
- Set default volume to 0.7

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Seven distinct sound effects added to assets folder
- [x] Sounds play immediately on cat click with no delay
- [x] Random selection works correctly
- [x] No sound overlap/cutting off
- [x] Sound files optimized (using .wav format)
- [x] Sounds work across major browsers
- [x] Memory usage remains reasonable

## Technical Solution
- Used native Audio API for simplicity and broad support
- Pre-loaded sounds for instant playback
- Implemented sound pooling for overlap prevention
- Added random selection logic that avoids repeats

## Learning Notes
- Audio API is simpler but less powerful than Web Audio API
- Pre-loading audio improves responsiveness but increases initial load
- Sound pooling prevents "cutting off" during rapid clicks
- Random selection with no-repeats improves perceived variety

## Future Improvements
- Add volume control for accessibility
- Consider lazy loading for faster page load
- Add Web Audio API support for more control
- Consider sound sprites for optimization
